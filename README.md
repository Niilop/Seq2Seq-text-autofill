# Seq2Seq-text-autofill
Simple seq2seq project with PyTorch predicting amazon product names

As for now, there is only colab notebook for training the model

Model training is trained on google colab and python implementation for inference will be made eventually


Plans for this project is to implement a simple "search bar" that will suggest (predict with seq2seq model) top 10 predictions for inserted word or word sequence.
Hopefully the model will be able to predict product names well.
